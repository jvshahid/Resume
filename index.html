<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>I love working on cool stuff with a bunch of smart people.  Most of
what you'll see in this resume was self taught, it started as a hobby
in high school and later became my career. So learning new things is an
important objective in my life as well. As I mentioned before, I am a
team player; an energetic and smart team that I like to work with and
learn from is also an important objective.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<h3>Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY</h3>

<p>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
B.S. Degree in Computer Engineering
Fall 2006 - Fall 2009</p>

<h3>Higher Technological Institute, Egypt</h3>

<p>Department of Electrical Engineering
Enrolled in B.S. Degree in Electrical Engineering
Fall 2002 - Spring 2005</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>I have been programming professionally since 2010, mainly using
the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Go</strong> (professional). I've been using Go for over a year and have
  submitted bug fixes to the repo previously (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong> (professional). I've been using Java for more than 5 years,
  although I prefer not to use it anymore for many reasons.</li>
<li><strong>C/C++</strong> (professional). I've been using C/C++ for the past 2
years, mainly to write services and libraries that will run under
Linux.</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong> (moderate). I'm not not really a Rubyist but I use Ruby for
  most of my scripting needs and love it as a language.</li>
<li><strong>Scala</strong> (moderate). I used Scala for quite sometime, mainly to
  build web services using <strong>Scalatra</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Bash</strong> (moderate). I'm by no means a good bash scripter but since
the shell is the heart of all Unix systems, I'm forced to use it on
a daily basis and get better at it everyday.</li>
<li><strong>Java Threads/PThreads</strong> (moderate). Aware of the common pitfalls
associated with using threads and have good debugging skills with
threading issues.</li>
<li><strong>NoSQL</strong>. I have recently used Redis for caching time series data
that is frequently requested by client applications.  I also setup
and maintained Cassandra as a time series db. I'm also the coauthor
and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb">InfluxDB</a> a
timeseries database written entirely in Golang and using many NoSQL
design concepts and tradeoff.</li>
<li><strong>Linux Administration</strong>. I don't call myself a sysadmin, but since
I use Linux personally and develop services that runs on Linux, I
became familiar with modifying kernel parameters such as choosing
different I/O schedulers as well as tools to debug and understand
performance issues (e.g. iotop, dstat, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>SQL</strong> (moderate). I know just enough SQL to get my job done and
  look up the documentation when it gets complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Other languages</strong>. I've previously used Clojure, Groovy/Grails,
  Rails, F#, Javascript, CoffeeScript, Haskell for small projects
  and for fun.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Professional experience</h3>

<h4>Errplane/InfluxDB</h4>

<h5>Software Engineer - July 2013 to Present</h5>

<p>Errplane is a cloud-based platform for monitoring application
performance, exceptions, uptime, and custom metrics in
real-time. Errplane open-sourced the core data store, InfluxDB, a
lightweight distributed time series, events, and metrics database
written entirely in Golang.</p>

<p>As part of being at Errplane, I worked on the following projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write and maintain a local metric collection agent, that can monitor
cpu, memory, load and processes possibly restarting them when a
problem is detected.</li>
<li>Build a query parser in yacc and lex for InfluxDB</li>
<li>Build, maintain and improve
<a href="https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb">InfluxDB</a> the open
source time series database that used to store all metric data for
Errplane.</li>
<li>Coordinate the open source community that were built around
InfluxDB. InfluxDB has gained the interest of the open source
community and new tools and libraries are constantly built by the
community. The tools range from command line interfaces to plugins
for metric collection and visualization tools.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Thomson Reuters</h4>

<h5>Software Engineer Contractor - December 2012 to July 2013</h5>

<p>As part of a team of two contractors we were tasked with building a
drop-in replacement for
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa167872%28v=office.11%29.aspx">Microsoft LCS</a>. The
responsibilities included the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">SIP</a> chat server
that is backward compatible with LCS and supports all of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246115.aspx">Microsoft's extensions</a>
to SIP and written entirely in Golang.</li>
<li>Integrate with other Thomson Reuters services and infrastructure.</li>
<li>Federate with other networks, e.g. Yahoo! and MSN which used a
slight variation of SIP.</li>
<li>Communicate with a large team of developers, operations and QA teams
located across the globe including Bangkok, London and New York
City.</li>
<li>Support hundreds of thousands of users logged in simultaneously to
the system and scale horizontally.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Benchmark Solutions.</h4>

<h5>Software Engineer - February 2010 to December 2012</h5>

<p>As an early employee at Benchmark Solutions I was responsible for
architecting, developing and maintaining a wide range of services and
processes that consitutes our realtime market data infrastructure
mostly built using open source software.</p>

<p>Working at Benchmark gave me the chance to get exposed to the Fixed
Income market and to build a complicated system by breaking it down
into smaller services/modules that are easy to build and
maintain. Below is an overview of the projects I worked on and
experiences I gained:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SINAPS</strong>. Although it started as a web service to serve historical
prices as well as last value data (most recent price) to our client
applications. It soon became the internal tool to easily inspect
data using a browser or pragmatically using the libraries that
were built for Matlab, C, Java and Ruby. The service grew to
encapsulate more complicated operations that were commonly used,
such as filtering, averaging and joining multiple time
series. SINAPS was written in Scala using Scalatra.</li>
<li><strong>Cassandra/Hadoop</strong>. Being a data company our time series db was an
important piece of the architecture. We started with a proprietary
solution and later moved to a Cassandra/Hadoop solution. I was responsible
for architecting the schema, as well as building libraries for C/C++ (using
the basic Thrift API), Ruby and Java to access the data with a simple API.
Hadoop was used for batch jobs, such as end of day calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Pubsub</strong>. While at Benchmark I had the chance to use a wide range
of messaging technologies and products, such as, 29West LBM (now
known as Informatica Ultra messaging), 0mq and rabbit mq.</li>
<li><strong>Team work</strong>. My responsibilities required me to continuously
communicate with the other teams, to make sure that they get what
they needed to get their work done as well as collect requirements
and discuss improvements to the infrastructure.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Open source experience</h3>

<p>Contributing back to the open source community is an important
activity in my daily life because I believe in the OSS mission and to
show gratitude to my fellow developers who continuously build awesome
software that I use on a daily basis.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://codereview.appspot.com/9795043">Golang</a></strong>. Fixed a bug in
the tls certificate checking code that prevented certificates with
long chains to be used in golang.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb">InfluxDB</a></strong>. A
  lightweight distributed time series, events, and metrics database.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri">Nokogiri</a></strong>. Core
maintainer of Nokogiri.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby">JRuby</a></strong>. Found and fixed
multiple bugs related to String encoding in JRuby 1.7 when running
in 1.9 mode and timezone handling.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">Ruby</a></strong>. Submitted a new test to
enhance coverage of String encoding as a result of a bug found in
JRuby.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.minix3.org/">Minix</a></strong>. As a college project I ported
the Linux O(1) scheduler which was designed and implemented by Ingo
Molnár to the Minix Operating System, though this work wasn't
published or contributed back to the Minix code base.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Undergraduate experience</h3>

<h4>Database applications testing research</h4>

<p>AGENDA is a software testing research project that focused on testing and verifying
database applications and their interactions with the database.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SWING</strong>. Reimplemented AGENDA as a SWING application as opposed to
a web app to provide a better user experience while reusing most of
the components used by the web based implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Input data generation</strong>. Improved the implementation of the fake
data generation phase by using an in memory db to filter the data
sets that violated any of the schema constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Papers</strong>. Shahid, Chays, Frankl. Query-based Test Generation for
Database Applications.  Proceedings of the 1st intentional workshop
on testing database systems, June 2008.</li>
