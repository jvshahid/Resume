<h2>Objectives (What am I looking for ?)</h2>

<p>Seeking a rewarding, challenging position with growth potential in a dynamic company that will
enhance both my programming, leadership and business skills.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<h3>Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY</h3>

<p>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering<br>
B.S. Degree in Computer Engineering<br>
Fall 2006 - Fall 2009</p>

<h3>Higher Technological Institute, Egypt</h3>

<p>Department of Electrical Engineering<br>
Enrolled in B.S. Degree in Electrical Engineering<br>
Fall 2002 - Spring 2005</p>

<h2>Skills (What do I know ?)</h2>

<p>I have been programming professionally since 2010, mainly using
the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong> (moderate). I&#39;m not not really a Rubyist but I use Ruby for most of my scripting needs and love it as a language.</li>
<li><strong>Scala</strong> (moderate). I&#39;ve been using Scala for quiet sometime now, mainly to build web services using <strong>Scalatra</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong> (professional). I&#39;ve been using Java for more than 5 years, although I prefer not to use it anymore for many reasons.</li>
<li><strong>C/C++</strong> (professional). I&#39;ve been using C/C++ for the past 2 years, mainly to write services and libraries that will run
under Linux.</li>
<li><strong>Bash</strong> (moderate). I&#39;m by no means a good bash scripter but since the shell is the heart of all Unix systems,
I&#39;m forced to use it on a daily basis and get better at it everyday.</li>
<li><strong>Java Threads/PThreads</strong> (moderate). Aware of the common pitfalls associated with using threads and have good debugging skills
with threading issues.</li>
<li><strong>NoSql</strong>. I have recently used Redis for caching time series data that is frequently requested by client applications.
I also setup and maintained Cassandra as a time series db.</li>
<li><strong>Linux Administration</strong>. I don&#39;t call myself a sysadmin, but since I use Linux personally as well as develop services
that runs on Linux, I became familiar with modifying kernel parameters such as choosing different I/O schedulers
as well as tools to debug and understand performance issues (e.g. iotop, dstat, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Other languages</strong>. I&#39;ve previously used Clojure, Groovy, Rails, F#, Javascript and SQL for small projects and for fun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience (What have I done ?)</h2>

<h3>Undergraduate experience</h3>

<h4>Database applications testing research</h4>

<p>AGENDA is a software testing research project that focused on testing and verifying
database applications and their interactions with the database.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SWING implementation</strong>. Reimplemented AGENDA as a SWING application as opposed
to a web app to provide a better user experience while reusing most of the components
used by the previous implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Input data generation</strong>. Improved the implementation of the fake data generation phase.</li>
<li><strong>Papers</strong>. Shahid, Chays, Frankl. Query-based Test Generation for Database Applications.
Proceedings of the 1st intentional workshop on testing database systems, June 2008.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional experience</h3>

<h4>Benchmark Solutions INC.</h4>

<h5>Software Engineer - February 2010 to Present</h5>

<p>I develop and maintain all the infrastructure services which integrates
client facing applications with the engine generated time series data.
During my time at Benchmark Solutions, I worked on the following projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented and currently maintain a home brewed solution to store our
generated time series database server built on top of <strong>Cassandra</strong>.</li>
<li>Implemented and currently maintain our <strong>messaging bus</strong>, which integrates
with our time series db, with bindings for <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>.</li>
<li>Implemented and currently maintain the web service that exposed the generated
time series data in JSON to our client facing web app and a .Net app</li>
</ul>

<h2>Open source experience</h2>

<p>Contributing back to the open source community is an important activity
in my daily life because I believe in the OSS mission and to show gratitude
to my fellow developers.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri">Nokogiri</a></strong>. Core maintainer of Nokogiri.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby">JRuby</a></strong>. Found and fixed a bug related to String encoding in JRuby 1.7 when running in 1.9 mode.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">Ruby</a></strong>. Submitted a new test to enhance coverage of String encoding as a result of a bug found in JRuby.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.minix3.org/">Minix</a></strong>. While in college I finished porting the Linux O(1) scheduler which was designed and implemented
by Ingo Malner to the Minix Operating System, though this work wasn&#39;t published or contributed back to the
Minix project.</li>
</ul>
