## Objectives (What am I looking for ?)

Seeking a rewarding, challenging position with growth potential in a dynamic company that will
enhance both my programming, leadership and business skills.

## Education

### Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY  
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  
B.S. Degree in Computer Engineering  
Fall 2006 - Fall 2009

### Higher Technological Institute, Egypt  
Department of Electrical Engineering  
Enrolled in B.S. Degree in Electrical Engineering  
Fall 2002 - Spring 2005

## Skills (What do I know ?)

I have been programming professionally since 2010, mainly using
the following technologies:

- **Ruby** (moderate). I'm not not really a Rubyist but I use Ruby for most of my scripting needs and love it as a language.
- **Scala** (moderate). I've been using Scala for quiet sometime now, mainly to build web services using **Scalatra**.
- **Java** (professional). I've been using Java for more than 5 years, although I prefer not to use it anymore for many reasons.
- **C/C++** (professional). I've been using C/C++ for the past 2 years, mainly to write services and libraries that will run
  under Linux.
- **Bash** (moderate). I'm by no means a good bash scripter but since the shell is the heart of all Unix systems,
  I'm forced to use it on a daily basis and get better at it everyday.
- **Java Threads/PThreads** (moderate). Aware of the common pitfalls associated with using threads and have good debugging skills
  with threading issues.
- **NoSql**. I have recently used Redis for caching time series data that is frequently requested by client applications.
  I also setup and maintained Cassandra as a time series db.
- **Linux Administration**. I don't call myself a sysadmin, but since I use Linux personally as well as develop services
  that runs on Linux, I became familiar with modifying kernel parameters such as choosing different I/O schedulers
  as well as tools to debug and understand performance issues (e.g. iotop, dstat, etc.).
- **Other languages**. I've previously used Clojure, Groovy, Rails, F#, Javascript and SQL for small projects and for fun.

## Experience (What have I done ?)

### Undergraduate experience

#### Database applications testing research

AGENDA is a software testing research project that focused on testing and verifying
database applications and their interactions with the database.

- **SWING implementation**. Reimplemented AGENDA as a SWING application as opposed
  to a web app to provide a better user experience while reusing most of the components
  used by the previous implementation.
- **Input data generation**. Improved the implementation of the fake data generation phase.
- **Papers**. Shahid, Chays, Frankl. Query-based Test Generation for Database Applications.
  Proceedings of the 1st intentional workshop on testing database systems, June 2008.

### Professional experience

#### Benchmark Solutions INC.

##### Software Engineer - February 2010 to Present

I develop and maintain all the infrastructure services which integrates
client facing applications with the engine generated time series data.
During my time at Benchmark Solutions, I worked on the following projects:

- Implemented and currently maintain a home brewed solution to store our
  generated time series database server built on top of **Cassandra**.
- Implemented and currently maintain our **messaging bus**, which integrates
  with our time series db, with bindings for **Ruby**, **C** and **Java**.
- Implemented and currently maintain the web service that exposed the generated
  time series data in JSON to our client facing web app and a .Net app

## Open source experience

Contributing back to the open source community is an important activity
in my daily life because I believe in the OSS mission and to show gratitude
to my fellow developers.

- **[Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri)**. Core maintainer of Nokogiri.
- **[JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby)**. Found and fixed a bug related to String encoding in JRuby 1.7 when running in 1.9 mode.
- **[Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)**. Submitted a new test to enhance coverage of String encoding as a result of a bug found in JRuby.
- **[Minix](http://www.minix3.org/)**. While in college I finished porting the Linux O(1) scheduler which was designed and implemented
  by Ingo Malner to the Minix Operating System, though this work wasn't published or contributed back to the
  Minix project.
